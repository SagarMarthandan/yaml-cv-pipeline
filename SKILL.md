# YAML CV Pipeline

End-to-end pipeline that takes a **Job Description (JD)** and produces a tailored ATS-optimized resume + cover letter as compiled PDFs, plus an archived JD reference and a visual-optimized alternate version.

## Pipeline Overview

```

```

## Prerequisites

- **Base Files Directory:**
  - **English:** `../Base Files/English/` (Base resume files)
  - **German:** `../Base Files/German/` (Base German files)
  - **Photo:** `../Base Files/Photo/` (Photo image files)
  - **Repo Info:** `../Base Files/Repo Info/` (Master portfolio `repo info.md` & `zvec_portfolio` vector database index)
- **Python Installation:** Python 3.10+ with dependencies installed from [requirements.txt](file:///c:/Users/sagar/Documents/YAML-CV/skills/yaml-cv-pipeline/requirements.txt) (`pyyaml`, `reportlab`, `pypdf`, `zvec`, `sentence-transformers` installed)
- **Working Directory:** `Applications/` (relative to project root)
- **Pipeline Script Structure:**
  - `yaml_to_pdf.py` — entry point; routes YAML files to the correct renderer
  - `renderers/utils.py` — shared utilities (`escape_latex`, color constants, `run_pdflatex`)
  - `renderers/resume.py` — Resume renderer (LaTeX primary, ReportLab fallback)
  - `renderers/cover_letter.py` — Cover Letter renderer (LaTeX primary, ReportLab fallback)
  - `renderers/job_description.py` — Job Description renderer (ReportLab only)
  - `renderers/ats_report.py` — ATS Report renderer (ReportLab only)
  - `organize_applications.py` — Sorts application folders into a Year/Month/Date tree (run after Step 3)

## General Writing & Style Rules (Stop-Slop)

To ensure all generated text sounds authentic and human, the pipeline step outputs (particularly resume bullet points and cover letter prose) must adhere to the **Stop-Slop** writing guidelines:
- **Core Principle:** Strictly eliminate predictable AI tells, structures, and rhythms.
- **Strict Active Voice:** Ensure every sentence leads with active human action. Avoid passive constructions.
- **Absolute Adverb Ban:** Do not use any adverbs ending in `-ly` or softening emphasis crutches (like *successfully*, *effectively*, *genuinely*, *actually*, *really*).
- **Zero Em-Dashes:** Punctuation em-dashes (`—`) are prohibited; use commas or periods.
- **No Throat-Clearing:** Start sentences directly. Cut preview/recap statements (e.g., *"at its core"*, *"it is worth noting"*, *"the reality is"*).

## Input Required

The user must provide:
1. **Job Description** — paste the full JD text
2. (Optional) **Language override** — if the user wants the output in a specific language different from the JD language

## Execution — Run All 3 Steps Sequentially

### STEP 1: Setup, ATS Analysis & Job Description Archival

Read and execute the full instructions in [01_ats_and_jd_archival.md](file:///c:/Users/sagar/Documents/YAML-CV/skills/yaml-cv-pipeline/01_ats_and_jd_archival.md).

Runs dependency check, parses and archives the job description, scores the base resume, performs location tailoring via web search to find the closest candidate city, and generates a tailored project list using the Zvec tool.

**ATS Scoring Model:** 4 equally-weighted categories of 25 points each (total = 100) — Keywords & Terminology, Experience Relevance, Technical Skills, Soft Skills & Language. Formatting is **not scored**; instead a non-scored `formatting_quality` verdict (`Excellent` / `Good` / `Average` / `Bad`) is emitted with suggested changes when `Average` or `Bad`. Score gate: `PROCEED` if total >= 85, else `HOLD`.

**Output:** `ATS_Report.yaml`, `ATS_Report.pdf`, `Job_Description.yaml`, `Job_Description.pdf`, and `project_info.md` in `[Company Name] — [Job Role]/` folder.

---

### STEP 2: Resume Rewrite & Visual Layout Audit

Read and execute the full instructions in [02_resume_and_visual_audit.md](file:///c:/Users/sagar/Documents/YAML-CV/skills/yaml-cv-pipeline/02_resume_and_visual_audit.md).

Rewrites the resume based on the ATS Improvement Blueprint and the tailored project list. Compiles the resume via LaTeX, performs a visual layout audit and Stop-Slop check, and updates the post-rewrite ATS score.

**Output:** `Resume.yaml`, `Layout_Audit_Report.yaml`, and `SAGAR_MARTHANDAN_Resume.pdf` / `SAGAR_MARTHANDAN_Lebenslauf.pdf` (and `Resume_v2.pdf` / `Lebenslauf_v2.pdf` if needed).

---

### STEP 3: Cover Letter Generation & Compilation

Read and execute the full instructions in [03_cover_letter.md](file:///c:/Users/sagar/Documents/YAML-CV/skills/yaml-cv-pipeline/03_cover_letter.md).

Generates a formal, metric-grounded cover letter standard conforming to German Geschäftsbrief layout in the target JD language.

**Output:** `Cover_Letter.yaml` and `SAGAR_MARTHANDAN_Cover_Letter.pdf` / `SAGAR_MARTHANDAN_Anschreiben.pdf`.

---

## Error Handling

If the compilation fails:
1. Check stdout/stderr console logs for PyYAML parser errors or ReportLab layout exceptions.
2. Verify YAML formatting is correct (e.g. check for unquoted colons, incorrect indentations).
3. If an image is missing, ensure Sagar.jpg is placed in the designated Base Files path.
4. If there's a layout overflow, trim the text length in the resume YAML.

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] `Job_Description.yaml` (with `location` key) & `Job_Description.pdf` are generated
- [ ] `project_info.md` (tailored project list) is generated in the company folder
